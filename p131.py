# Prime cube partnership
# Problem 131 
# There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n^3 + n^2p is a perfect cube.

# For example, when p = 19, 8^3 + 8^2Ã—19 = 12^3.

# What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

# How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?

# Analysis:
# n^3 + n^2p = m^3
# the only possible soltion is
# n = k^3, m = k^2(k+1), hence p = 3*k^2+3*k+1
